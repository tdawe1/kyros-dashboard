Context Reset: New subtask
Task: T-402 — Enforce develop as PR base and size guard
Lane: ci
Branch: feat/T-402-enforce-develop-as-pr-base-and-size-guar

DoD:
- Satisfy acceptance; tests updated/passing
- Static checks clean; no secrets
- PR reviewed by a critic

Acceptance:
- PRs targeting `main` are flagged with failure and guidance
- PRs with >1000 LOC diff add a 'needs-split' label and fail guard
- PR template shows base-branch and scope checklist
- `collab-guard.yml` documents rules in-file

Changescope:
- .github/workflows/collab-guard.yml
- .github/pull_request_template.md

Output: code changes only; summarize what changed and suggest next subtask.
