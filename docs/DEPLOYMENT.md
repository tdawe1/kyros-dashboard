# Deployment Guide

This guide covers the complete deployment setup for the Kyros Dashboard, including automatic deployment after merging to the main branch.

## üöÄ Automatic Deployment Overview

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD with the following workflow:

1. **Quality Checks**: Run on every PR and push to main/develop
2. **Staging Deployment**: Automatic deployment to staging environment for feature branches
3. **Production Deployment**: Automatic deployment to production when merging to main

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Accounts
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Vercel account (for frontend deployment)
- Railway or Render account (for backend deployment)
- Slack workspace (optional, for notifications)

### Required Secrets

#### GitHub Repository Secrets
Add these secrets in your GitHub repository under Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions:

```bash
# Vercel Configuration
VERCEL_TOKEN=your-vercel-token

   - Set up custom domain if needed

3. **Get Render API Key**:
   - Go to Render Account Settings ‚Üí API Keys
   - Create new API key
   - Add to GitHub secrets as `RENDER_API_KEY`

## üîÑ Deployment Workflows

### Main Branch (Production)
- **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch
- **Actions**:
  1. Run all tests and quality checks
  2. Deploy frontend to Vercel (production)
  3. Deploy backend to Railway/Render (production)
  4. Send notification (if configured)

### Feature Branches (Staging)
- **Trigger**: Push to `develop` or `feature/*` branches
- **Actions**:
  1. Run quality checks
  2. Deploy to staging environment
  3. Comment on PR with staging URLs

### Pull Requests
- **Trigger**: Open/update PR to `main` or `develop`
- **Actions**:
  1. Run comprehensive quality checks
  2. Security scanning
  3. Performance analysis
  4. Build verification

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow Files

The following GitHub Actions workflows are configured:

### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Main deployment workflow
- Handles production deployments
- Includes testing, building, and deployment steps

### `.github/workflows/quality-checks.yml`
- Quality assurance workflow
- Security scanning, linting, and testing
- Runs on PRs and pushes

### `.github/workflows/staging.yml`
- Staging deployment workflow
- Deploys feature branches to staging
- Comments on PRs with staging URLs

## üîç Monitoring and Notifications

### Health Checks
- Frontend: Vercel automatically monitors deployment health
- Backend: Health check endpoint at `/api/health`

### Notifications
- GitHub Actions status updates
- Optional Slack notifications for deployment status
- PR comments with staging URLs

### Logs and Debugging
- GitHub Actions logs for CI/CD issues
- Vercel function logs for frontend issues
- Railway/Render logs for backend issues

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Deployment Fails on Tests**:
   - Check test results in GitHub Actions
   - Fix failing tests before deployment
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

2. **Environment Variables Missing**:
   - Verify all required secrets are set in GitHub
   - Check environment variable names match exactly
   - Ensure secrets are available in the correct environment

3. **Build Failures**:
   - Check build logs in GitHub Actions
   - Verify Node.js and Python versions
   - Ensure all dependencies are in package.json/requirements.txt

4. **Vercel Deployment Issues**:
   - Check Vercel project settings
   - Verify build command and output directory
   - Check environment variables in Vercel dashboard

5. **Railway/Render Issues**:
   - Check service logs
   - Verify start command and port configuration
   - Ensure environment variables are set

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test local build
cd ui && npm run build
cd api && python -c "import main; print('API imports successfully')"

# Check environment variables
echo $VITE_API_BASE_URL
# Check if OPENAI_API_KEY is set (without exposing the value)
if [ -n "$OPENAI_API_KEY" ]; then
  echo "‚úÖ OPENAI_API_KEY is configured"
else
  echo "‚ùå OPENAI_API_KEY is not set"
fi

# Test API locally
cd api && uvicorn main:app --reload
```

- [Vercel Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs)
- [Railway Documentation](https://docs.railway.app)
- [Render Documentation](https://render.com/docs)
- [CI/CD Secrets Guide](CI_SECRETS.md)
- [Security Setup Guide](SECURITY_SETUP.md)

## üîê Security Considerations

- All secrets are stored securely in GitHub repository secrets
- Environment variables are not exposed in build logs
- Pre-commit hooks prevent accidental secret commits
- Security scanning runs on every PR
- Production deployments require main branch merge
- **Important**: VITE_* values are baked into the client bundle and must never contain secrets
- Store sensitive values only on the server or in backend-only environment variables
- Use server-side endpoints, GitHub secrets, or runtime server envs for secrets
- Use .env.local for local development only (never commit to version control)

## üìà Performance Optimization

- Frontend builds are cached for faster deployments
- Dependencies are cached in GitHub Actions
- Bundle analysis runs on every PR
- Performance budgets can be configured in Vercel

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Set up monitoring and alerting
2. Configure custom domains
3. Set up database migrations
4. Implement blue-green deployments
5. Add performance monitoring
6. Set up error tracking (Sentry)
