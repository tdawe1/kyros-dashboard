from pathlib import Path

class JulesServer(BaseJSONRPCServer):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("jules-testing")
        self.test_results = {}
        self.coverage_data = {}
    
    async def generate_tests(self, file_path: str, test_type: str = "unit") -> dict:
        """Generate tests for a specific file"""
        # Implementation for test generation
        pass
    
    async def analyze_coverage(self, test_suite: str = "all") -> dict:
        """Analyze test coverage and identify gaps"""
        # Implementation for coverage analysis
        pass
    
    async def run_quality_gates(self, branch: str = "develop") -> dict:
        """Run quality gates and return results"""
        # Implementation for quality gate execution
        pass
    
    async def optimize_tests(self, test_suite: str = "all") -> dict:
        """Optimize test execution and performance"""
        # Implementation for test optimization
        pass
