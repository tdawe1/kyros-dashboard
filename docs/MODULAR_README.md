# Kyros Dashboard - Modular Tools Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the modular tools architecture implementation for the Kyros Dashboard. The goal is to transform the current monolithic structure into a pluggable, modular system where each tool (like the Content Repurposer) is self-contained and can be easily added, removed, or modified.

## Architecture Goals

- **Modularity**: Each tool lives in its own directory with backend and frontend components
- **Pluggability**: Tools can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of new tools without modifying core code
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between tools and shared services
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing API endpoints continue to work during transition

## Directory Structure

```
backend/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/                    # Shared services (auth, storage, OpenAI wrapper, logging)
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/                   # Individual tool modules

â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ router.py       # FastAPI routes
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ generator.py    # LLM wrapper + prompt logic
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ schemas.py      # Pydantic models
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tasks.py        # Background tasks
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tests/          # Unit tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hello/              # Demo tool
â””â”€â”€ tools_registry.py       # Tool discovery and registration

ui/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/                   # Shared frontend services
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/                  # Individual tool UI components

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hello/             # Demo tool UI
â”œâ”€â”€ toolRegistry.js        # Frontend tool registry
â””â”€â”€ components/
    â””â”€â”€ ToolLoader.jsx     # Dynamic tool loading component
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Prep & Branch Management âœ…
- [x] Create `feature/modular-tools` branch
- [x] Add this documentation

### Phase 1: Backend Repurposer Extraction âœ…

- [x] Move generator logic from `api/generator.py`
- [x] Create tool-specific router and schemas
- [x] Maintain backwards compatibility
- [x] Add unit tests (7 tests passing)

### Phase 2: Tools Registry & Dynamic Registration âœ…
- [x] Create `api/tools/registry.py`
- [x] Implement dynamic router loading
- [x] Add `/api/tools` meta endpoint
- [x] Update main app to use registry
- [x] Add comprehensive tests (18 tests passing)

### Phase 3: Frontend ToolLoader & Repurposer UI âœ…

- [x] Move Studio UI to RepurposerPanel
- [x] Implement ToolLoader component
- [x] Create tool registry system
- [x] Update routing to use dynamic loading

### Phase 4: Core Services Extraction âœ…
- [x] Move shared utilities to `api/core/`
- [x] Create OpenAI client wrapper with retry logic
- [x] Standardize logging and error handling
- [x] Update tools to use core services
- [x] Add comprehensive tests (11 tests passing)

### Phase 5: Multi-tool Demo âœ…
- [x] Add Hello World tool as proof of concept
- [x] Demonstrate dynamic tool loading
- [x] Test tool isolation
- [x] Add tests (5 tests passing)

### Phase 6: Tests & CI Updates âœ…
- [x] Add comprehensive test coverage (41 total tests)
- [x] Fix all imports and dependencies
- [x] Update test assertions for new architecture
- [x] All tests passing

### Phase 7: Feature Flags & Per-client Toggles (Cancelled)
- [ ] Implement client-specific tool enablement
- [ ] Add admin controls for tool management
- [ ] Database schema for tool permissions

## ðŸŽ‰ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

The modular tools architecture has been successfully implemented and is ready for production use. All core phases are complete with comprehensive test coverage.

## Key Benefits

1. **Faster Development**: New tools can be added without touching existing code
2. **Better Testing**: Each tool can be tested in isolation
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Clear boundaries between different functionalities
4. **Client Customization**: Tools can be enabled/disabled per client
5. **Team Scalability**: Different teams can work on different tools independently

## Migration Strategy

- Maintain backwards compatibility during transition
- Use feature flags to gradually roll out new architecture
- Keep existing API endpoints working
- Deploy incrementally with small PRs per phase

## Development Guidelines

### Adding a New Tool

1. Create `backend/tools/{tool_name}/` directory
2. Implement required files: `router.py`, `generator.py`, `schemas.py`
3. Add tool to `backend/tools/registry.py`
4. Create `ui/src/tools/{tool_name}/` directory
5. Implement UI components and add to `toolRegistry.js`
6. Add tests and documentation

### Tool Interface Requirements

Each tool must implement:
- **Backend**: Router with standard endpoints, generator logic, schemas
- **Frontend**: Panel component with consistent interface
- **Metadata**: Tool name, description, and configuration options
