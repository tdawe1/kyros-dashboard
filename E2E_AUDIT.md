# Frontend E2E Test Audit and Improvement Plan

This document summarizes the audit of the frontend End-to-End (E2E) test suite and proposes improvements to enhance test coverage and robustness.

## 1. E2E Setup Audit

The E2E test setup using Playwright is well-configured.

- **`playwright.config.js`**: The `baseURL` is correctly set to `http://localhost:3001`, with the flexibility to be overridden by an environment variable. The `webServer` is properly configured to start the frontend development server before running the tests.
- **`vite.config.js`**: The Vite development server is configured to run on port `3001`, which is consistent with the Playwright configuration.

**Conclusion**: The E2E setup is correct and consistent.

## 2. Test Coverage Audit

The existing test suite provides good coverage for the main features of the application.

- **`navigation.spec.js`**: Covers all major navigation aspects, including page transitions, sidebar, theme toggle, mobile navigation, and breadcrumbs.
- **`studio.spec.js`**: Thoroughly tests the core "Studio" feature, including input validation, content generation, variant interaction, and error handling.
- **`full-flow.spec.js`**: Provides a good end-to-end test of the main user flow.

## 3. Proposed Improvements

While the current test coverage is good, the following improvements are recommended to increase confidence in the application's stability and reduce the risk of regressions.

### 3.1. Add Authentication Flow Tests

**Priority**: High

**Description**: The authentication flow is a critical part of the application, but it is not currently covered by E2E tests. New tests should be created to cover:
- User login with valid and invalid credentials.
- User logout.
- Access to protected routes for authenticated and unauthenticated users.
- Redirection after login/logout.

### 3.2. Add Tests for "Jobs" and "Settings" Pages

**Priority**: Medium

**Description**: The `navigation.spec.js` file only verifies that the "Jobs" and "Settings" pages load. New tests should be added to cover the functionality within these pages:

- **Jobs Page**:
  - Searching and filtering jobs.
  - Viewing job details.
  - Pagination.
- **Settings Page**:
  - Creating, updating, and deleting presets.

### 3.3. Use More Specific Selectors

**Priority**: Low

**Description**: Some tests rely on generic text-based selectors (e.g., `text=Success`, `text=Error`). These can make the tests brittle and less readable. It is recommended to use `data-testid` attributes for key elements to create more robust and maintainable tests.

### 3.4. Implement Data-Driven Tests

**Priority**: Low

**Description**: The test for different channels in `full-flow.spec.js` can be refactored into a data-driven test. This would make it easier to add more channels in the future and would reduce code duplication.

### 3.5. Introduce Visual Regression Testing

**Priority**: Low

**Description**: To catch unintended visual changes, consider integrating a visual regression testing tool like Percy or Applitools. This would add another layer of quality assurance, especially for a UI-focused application.
