# **ARCHITECTURAL AUDIT REPORT: KYROS-DASHBOARD**
## **Axiom's Analysis Based on Actual Codebase**

## **PHASE 1: Code Cartography & De-tangling**

### **High-Level Purpose**
Based on the actual codebase analysis, this is a dual-purpose platform:
1. **Traditional System**: AI-powered content generation platform for multi-channel content repurposing
2. **Advanced System**: Multi-agent collaboration framework for distributed AI development with event sourcing

### **Tech Stack & Dependencies (Verified)**

**Frontend (`App.jsx`):**
- React with React Router for SPA
- TanStack Query for server state (5-minute stale time, retry logic with exponential backoff)
- Vite development server
- ErrorBoundary and ToastProvider for UX
- Dynamic tool loading via `ToolLoader` component

**Backend (`main.py`):**
- FastAPI with resilient startup (graceful degradation if modules fail)
- Modular import strategy with `safe_import` wrapper
- Sentry integration (optional)
- JWT authentication (when available)
- CORS middleware with configurable origins
- Health endpoints that work even if other modules fail

**Collaboration System (`agents.md`, `collab_cli.py`):**
- Event sourcing with append-only `events.jsonl`
- Lease-based locking with TTL (15 minutes) and heartbeat (5 minutes)
- ETag-based optimistic concurrency control
- Five agent roles: Planner, Implementer, Critic, Integrator, Watchdog
- State machine for task lifecycle

### **Architectural Components**

**Data Models (from architecture.md):**
- Traditional: User, ContentJob, ContentVariant, Preset, ScheduledJob
- Collaboration: Task, Lock, Agent, Event
- State files: `tasks.json`, `locks.json`, `agents.json`

**Key Services:**
- Core modules: auth, database, scheduler, input_validation, error_handling
- Tool registry with plugin architecture
- MCP servers: kyros_collab, linear, railway, vercel, coderabbit

### **Data Flow Analysis**
```
Traditional Flow:
User → React Frontend → FastAPI → Content Generation → PostgreSQL/Redis → UI Updates

Collaboration Flow:
Plan Import (Google Drive) → Task Generation → Agent Claims → 
Branch Creation → Implementation → PR/Review → Integration → Event Log
```

## **PHASE 2: Critical Flaw Identification**

### **A. Security Vulnerability Assessment**

#### **1. Unsafe Dynamic Imports in main.py**
- **Title**: Dynamic module imports without validation
- **Location**: File: `main.py`, Lines: 31-45 (safe_import function)
- **Severity**: [P0-CRITICAL]
- **Code Snippet**:
```python
def safe_import(module_name, import_func):
    try:
        return import_func()
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Failed to import {module_name}: {e}")
        return None
```
- **Analysis**: The lambda functions passed to `safe_import` use `__import__` without any validation. This could potentially be exploited if module names come from user input anywhere in the system.
- **Recommendation**: Whitelist allowed modules explicitly. Never use `__import__` with user-controlled strings.

#### **2. Missing Authentication on Critical Endpoints**
- **Title**: Generate endpoint lacks authentication check
- **Location**: File: `main.py`, Lines: 196-251
- **Severity**: [P0-CRITICAL]
- **Code Snippet**:
```python
@app.post("/api/generate")
async def generate_simple(request: dict):
    """Simple generate endpoint for basic functionality"""
    # No auth check here!
```
- **Analysis**: The `/api/generate` endpoint processes requests without verifying authentication, only checking quotas if the module is available.
- **Recommendation**: Always require authentication for resource-consuming endpoints. Add `@require_auth` decorator.

#### **3. Weak Lock Implementation**
- **Title**: Race condition in lease acquisition
- **Location**: File: `collab_cli.py`, Lines: 134-159
- **Severity**: [P1-HIGH]
- **Analysis**: The lease acquisition reads state, checks for conflicts, then writes. Between read and write, another process could acquire the same lock, leading to dual ownership.
- **Recommendation**: Use database transactions or distributed lock service (Redlock/Zookeeper).

### **B. Brittleness & Maintainability Analysis**

#### **4. Fragile Module Loading Strategy**
- **Title**: Silent failures hide critical issues
- **Location**: File: `main.py`, Lines: 31-170
- **Severity**: [P1-HIGH]
- **Analysis**: The application continues running even if critical modules like authentication fail to load. This creates unpredictable behavior and security risks.
- **Recommendation**: Define required vs optional modules. Fail fast for required modules.

#### **5. Manual Event Format Migration**
- **Title**: Legacy event format conversion in runtime
- **Location**: File: `collab_cli.py`, Lines: 77-127
- **Severity**: [P2-MEDIUM]
- **Code Snippet**:
```python
def normalize_event_format(event: dict) -> dict:
    """Shim to convert old kind/action format to new event format."""
    if "event" in event:
        return event
    # Complex manual mapping...
```
- **Analysis**: Runtime conversion of legacy events adds complexity and performance overhead. This should be a one-time migration.
- **Recommendation**: Create migration script to convert all legacy events offline, remove runtime shim.

#### **6. Hardcoded Configuration Values**
- **Title**: Magic numbers throughout collaboration system
- **Location**: File: `collab_cli.py`, Lines: 29-30
- **Severity**: [P2-MEDIUM]
- **Code Snippet**:
```python
TTL_SECONDS = 900
HEARTBEAT_SECONDS = 300
```
- **Analysis**: Critical timing values are hardcoded, making them difficult to tune for different environments.
- **Recommendation**: Move to environment variables or configuration file.

### **C. Failure Route & Resilience Analysis**

#### **7. No Circuit Breaker for External Services**
- **Title**: Missing circuit breaker for Google Drive imports
- **Location**: File: `plan-import.yml`, Lines: 25-52
- **Severity**: [P1-HIGH]
- **Analysis**: The plan import workflow directly calls Google Drive API without retry logic or circuit breaking. Transient failures will break the entire import process.
- **Recommendation**: Implement exponential backoff with jitter, add circuit breaker pattern.

#### **8. Unhandled Query Client Errors**
- **Title**: Frontend lacks global error handling for failed queries
- **Location**: File: `App.jsx`, Lines: 14-24
- **Severity**: [P1-HIGH]
- **Code Snippet**:
```javascript
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      retry: 3,
      // No onError handler
    },
```
- **Analysis**: Failed queries after retries have no global error handler, potentially leaving UI in inconsistent state.
- **Recommendation**: Add global `onError` handler with user notification and state recovery.

#### **9. Context Reset Protocol Complexity**
- **Title**: Manual context management prone to drift
- **Location**: File: `agents.md`, Lines: 105-126
- **Severity**: [P1-HIGH]
- **Analysis**: The context reset protocol requires agents to manually clear context between subtasks. This is error-prone and will lead to context pollution.
- **Recommendation**: Implement automatic context isolation using process isolation or containerization.

## **PHASE 3: Strategic Refactoring Roadmap**

### **Executive Summary**
The Kyros Dashboard exhibits a Jekyll-and-Hyde architecture: a traditional web application bolted onto an experimental multi-agent collaboration system. The resilient module loading in `main.py` shows awareness of failure modes but implements the wrong solution (silent degradation instead of explicit failure). The collaboration system is sophisticated but built on file-based state management that cannot scale. Critical security vulnerabilities exist in both authentication and dynamic imports.

### **Prioritized Action Plan**

**[P0-CRITICAL] - Immediate Actions (48 hours)**
1. **Fix Authentication Bypass** - Add authentication middleware to all endpoints
2. **Remove Dynamic Import Risk** - Whitelist all importable modules  
3. **Add Rate Limiting** - Implement proper rate limiting on `/api/generate`

**[P1-HIGH] - Week 1**
1. **Replace File-Based Locking** - Migrate to PostgreSQL advisory locks or Redis
2. **Add Circuit Breakers** - Implement for all external service calls
3. **Fix Module Loading** - Define critical modules that must load or app fails
4. **Add Global Error Handlers** - Both frontend and backend need proper error boundaries

**[P2-MEDIUM] - Week 2-3**
1. **Migrate Legacy Events** - One-time conversion, remove runtime shim
2. **Extract Configuration** - Move all hardcoded values to config
3. **Implement Proper State Machine** - Use a real state machine library for task transitions
4. **Add Telemetry** - OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing

### **Testing & Validation Strategy**
```python
# Priority test scenarios
1. Security: Attempt to bypass auth on all endpoints
2. Concurrency: Simulate 10 agents acquiring same lock
3. Resilience: Kill Redis/PostgreSQL during operations  
4. Scale: Generate 1000 concurrent tasks
5. Integration: Full flow from Drive import to PR merge
```

### **Documentation Blueprint**
1. **Security Runbook** - How to respond to auth bypass attempts
2. **Agent Onboarding** - How to add new agent types
3. **State Recovery** - How to rebuild from events.jsonl
4. **Configuration Guide** - All environment variables and their impacts

## **Fundamental Architectural Changes for AI Agents**

Given that future work will be performed by AI agents, here are the critical architectural changes needed:

### **1. Declarative State Management**
Replace procedural state updates with declarative specifications:
```yaml
# Instead of manual status updates
tasks:
  - id: T-001
    desired_state: completed
    constraints:
      - all_tests_pass
      - review_approved
    auto_transitions: true
```

### **2. Schema-First Development**
Every data structure must have a schema that agents can validate against:
```python
# schemas/task.py
from pydantic import BaseModel
class TaskSchema(BaseModel):
    id: str
    status: Literal["queued", "in_progress", ...]
    class Config:
        schema_extra = {"example": {...}}
```

### **3. Idempotent Operations Everywhere**
Every operation must be safely retryable:
```python
# Bad
def update_task(task_id, status):
    task.status = status
    
# Good  
def ensure_task_status(task_id, status, idempotency_key):
    if check_idempotency(idempotency_key):
        return cached_result
    # ... perform update
```

### **4. Event-Driven Architecture (Proper)**
Replace file watching with proper event bus:
```python
# Use Kafka/RabbitMQ/Redis Streams
event_bus.publish("task.claimed", {
    "task_id": "T-001",
    "agent": "impl-1",
    "timestamp": utcnow()
})
```

### **5. Contract Testing Between Agents**
Each agent must declare its inputs/outputs:
```python
@agent_contract(
    inputs={"task_id": str, "files": List[str]},
    outputs={"pr_number": int, "branch": str}
)
async def implementer_agent(inputs):
    # Implementation
```

### **6. Automated Rollback Mechanisms**
Every change must be reversible:
```python
class ReversibleOperation:
    def execute(self): pass
    def rollback(self): pass
    def verify(self): pass
```

### **Overall Assessment Score: 4/10**

**Strengths:**
- Sophisticated event sourcing design
- Resilient module loading attempt
- Clear separation of concerns in architecture

**Critical Weaknesses:**
- File-based state management won't scale
- Missing authentication on key endpoints  
- No proper distributed systems primitives
- Manual coordination instead of orchestration

**Verdict:** The platform shows ambitious architectural thinking but implements distributed systems patterns using local filesystem primitives. This is like building a race car with bicycle wheels - the engine is powerful but the foundation cannot support it. The immediate security vulnerabilities must be fixed before any production use. The collaboration system should be rebuilt on proper distributed systems infrastructure (Kubernetes operators, service mesh, event streaming) rather than files and shell scripts.

For a consulting agency hub, this needs fundamental re-architecture to support multi-tenant isolation, proper RBAC, and enterprise-grade reliability.
