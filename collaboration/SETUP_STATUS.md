#### **Vercel (For frontend deployment)**
1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Create new project
4. Connect your repository
5. Set root directory to `frontend`
6. Get API token from account settings

#### **GitHub (For CI/CD)**

   - Use different database/Redis instances

## 📊 **Current Configuration Summary:**

| Service | Status | Action Needed |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Linear | ✅ Ready | Implement features |
| Sentry | ✅ Ready | Start monitoring |
| Railway DB | ✅ Ready | Deploy backend |
| Railway Redis | ✅ Ready | Deploy backend |
| OpenAI | ❌ Missing | Get API key |
| Vercel | ❌ Missing | Set up account |
| GitHub | ❌ Missing | Get token |

## 🎯 **Recommended Order:**

1. **Get OpenAI API key** (required for app functionality)
2. **Test local development** (make sure everything works)
3. **Set up Vercel** (for frontend deployment)
4. **Set up GitHub token** (for CI/CD)
5. **Deploy to Railway** (backend deployment)
6. **Configure staging environment**

## 💡 **Quick Test:**

You can test your current setup by running:
```bash
# This will show you exactly what's missing
python scripts/test-env-with-dotenv.py
```

The script will tell you which variables are still using placeholder values and need to be updated with real values.
