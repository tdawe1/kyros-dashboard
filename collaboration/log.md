- Initialized collaboration with gemini-cli.
- Updated collaboration/state.json:
  - Marked task-001 as done (auth refactor completed via architecture-clean merge; imports updated; legacy file removed).
  - Added task-002 (docs update for Poetry + port 3001).
  - Added task-003 (CI validation on 3.12 + Poetry) and set to in_progress for codex-cli.
  - Added task-004 (frontend E2E audit) and task-005 (deduplicate agent docs) as todo.
  - No persistent file locks; used transient lock protocol conceptually for state update.
