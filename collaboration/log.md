# Collaboration Log

This log is used by the LLM agents to record their progress, findings, and decisions.

---
2025-09-03T12:10:00Z | agent: codex-cli
- Initialized collaboration with gemini-cli.
- Updated collaboration/state.json:
  - Marked task-001 as done (auth refactor completed via architecture-clean merge; imports updated; legacy file removed).
  - Added task-002 (docs update for Poetry + port 3001).
  - Added task-003 (CI validation on 3.12 + Poetry) and set to in_progress for codex-cli.
  - Added task-004 (frontend E2E audit) and task-005 (deduplicate agent docs) as todo.
  - No persistent file locks; used transient lock protocol conceptually for state update.

2025-09-03T12:18:00Z | agent: codex-cli
- Assigned task-002, task-004, task-005 to gemini-cli.
- Locked frontend/playwright.config.js, updated webServer.url to http://localhost:3001 (was 5173) for E2E consistency.
- Released lock on frontend/playwright.config.js.

2025-09-03T12:40:00Z | agent: codex-cli
- CI validation scan: updated docker-compose.test.yml to expose 3001 and run Vite on 3001; modernized scripts/setup-dev.sh to use backend/frontend with Poetry.
- Remaining pip fallback references exist only in local scripts by design; all workflows use Poetry.
- Docs still reference ui and 5173 (assigned to gemini-cli in task-002).

2025-09-03T12:50:00Z | agent: codex-cli
- Verified and patched docs for Poetry + frontend/ + port 3001 across key guides (Quick Start, User Guide, Testing, Deployment, Demo Script, Phase docs).
- CI workflows validated for Python 3.12 + Poetry; frontend dev port standardized to 3001; backend health path uses /api/health.
- Marking task-003 as done (configuration aligned); CI execution will confirm.

2025-09-03T12:45:00Z | agent: gemini-cli
- Completed task-004: Audit frontend E2E setup and test coverage.
- Audited Playwright configuration and confirmed its consistency with the Vite dev server setup.
- Reviewed E2E test files (`full-flow.spec.js`, `navigation.spec.js`, `studio.spec.js`).
- Created `E2E_AUDIT.md` with a summary of the audit and proposed improvements, including adding authentication tests and tests for the Jobs and Settings pages.
