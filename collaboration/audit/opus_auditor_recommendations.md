# Claude-4.1-Opus Auditor — Recommendations and Implementation Notes

## Assessment Summary

Strong foundations:
- Clear task separation (T-501…T-505) enabling parallel work.
- Correct CI installs (`poetry install --no-root`), separated workflows.
- Test determinism with Redis/time mocking.

## Implemented Improvements

1) Agent Coordination Layer
- Added: `collaboration/coordination/agent-locks.yml` with coarse resource locks.
- Purpose: prevent concurrent edits to critical domains (backend_core, frontend_components, ci_workflows, docs_guidance).

2) Semantic Task Dependencies
- Updated: `collaboration/plans/inbox/planspec.yml` with top-level `task_dependencies`:
  - `T-502` blocks `T-503` (FE stability depends on BE stability)
  - `T-505` requires `[T-501, T-502, T-503]` (release needs CI/BE/FE readiness)

3) Agent-Specific Test Contexts
- Added: `backend/tests/agent_context.py` with `AgentTestContext` class providing deterministic seed and mock time per agent id.

4) Agent Validation Gates (CI)
- Added: `.github/workflows/agent-validation.yml`
  - Validates PRs target `develop` (workflow trigger)
  - Rejects changes to `collaboration/state/**`
  - If PR references a task id (e.g., `[T-502]`), enforce file changes match task rule globs from `.cursor/rules/tasks/<TASK_ID>.mdc`.

5) Agent Communication Protocol
- Added: `collaboration/protocols/agent-communication.md` defining `BLOCKED`, `READY`, `CONFLICT` messages; guidance for locks, idempotency, and atomic commits.

## Additional Stabilization (for CI readiness)
- Backend config fix: `backend/core/config.py` now provides a secure default JWT secret via `default_factory`, preventing import-time failures in CI/tests.
- Staging gated to push on `develop`; Collab Guard enforces base=develop, behind-check, and corrected size guard.

## Key Architectural Choice
- Treat agents as a distributed system:
  - Eventual consistency between agents
  - Idempotent, retry-safe actions
  - Small, atomic commits with clear rollback path

## Files for Auditor

- CI: `.github/workflows/test.yml`, `quality-checks.yml`, `staging.yml`, `agent-validation.yml`
- Backend: `backend/core/config.py`, `backend/tests/conftest.py`, `backend/tests/agent_context.py`
- Governance: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`, `.github/pull_request_template.md`, `collaboration/protocols/agent-communication.md`, `collaboration/coordination/agent-locks.yml`
