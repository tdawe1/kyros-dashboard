**Scope**
- Summary log of actions and decisions since this session started to brief the next Architect on context, rationale, and current state.

**Timeline**
- Initial CI triage and PR reviews (21–22): identified failing checks, base-branch mismatch (main vs develop), and scope/size issues.
- Drafted a 3‑agent PlanSpec (T‑401…T‑406); later replaced with a focused develop‑stabilization plan (T‑501…T‑505).
- Implemented CI hardening (size guard fix, behind check, staging gate, poetry install fix).
- Split work across Backend, Frontend, Docs; merged targeted PRs; prepared release PR readiness.
- Added agent‑collaboration architecture: resource locks, agent validation gate, communication protocol, and optional scale to 5 agents.
- Created a standard Architect Prompt for repeatable planning.

**PlanSpec**
- Current: `collaboration/plans/inbox/planspec.yml` (plan_id: 2025‑09‑04‑stabilize‑develop‑release)
- Lanes: planner, ci, backend, frontend, docs; critic role aligned per lane
- Tasks:
  - T‑501 (ci): Gate staging + finalize installs — status: done (merged)
  - T‑502 (backend): Make backend‑tests green 3.12/3.13 — status: approved/merged
  - T‑503 (frontend): Fix build + unit tests — status: approved/merged
  - T‑504 (docs): Document branch model + PR policy — status: approved/auto‑merge queued
  - T‑505 (ci): Integrate develop → main release — status: pending green develop
- Dependencies (added):
  - T‑502 blocks T‑503 (FE stability depends on BE)
  - T‑505 requires [T‑501, T‑502, T‑503]

**CI Changes**
- Collab Guard: `.github/workflows/collab-guard.yml`
  - Enforces base=develop; behind check (fail if branch behind); size guard via `git diff --numstat` (adds+deletes); release exception for develop→main
  - PR: #27 merged
- Test Workflow: `.github/workflows/test.yml`
  - Poetry install with `--no-root` across backend installs (avoids packaging the project)
  - Prettier check non‑blocking inside frontend-tests (format still enforced in quality checks)
  - PR: #28 (ruff/Prettier), #30 (poetry `--no-root`) merged
- Quality Checks: `.github/workflows/quality-checks.yml`
  - Poetry `--no-root` in security/lint jobs
  - PR: #30 merged
- Staging: `.github/workflows/staging.yml`
  - Gated to run only on push to develop (prevents PR failures without secrets)
  - PR: #31 merged
- Release Readiness: posted checklist comment on PR #18 (develop→main)

**Backend Changes**
- Default JWT secret (import‑time unblock): `backend/core/config.py`
  - `jwt_secret_key` now uses a secure default via default_factory; production should still set env var
  - Pushed to develop; rebase handled branch protection
- Rate limiter tests stabilized under T‑403 earlier context; retained deterministic time/Redis handling in `backend/tests/conftest.py`

**Frontend Changes**
- Build + tests stabilized; formatting noise reduced
  - PR #33 merged (T‑503)
  - ReadyBadge formatting PR #29 merged

**Docs and Governance**
- Branch Model and PR Policy:
  - CONTRIBUTING.md and README.md updated (target develop; “Update branch”; release via develop→main); PR template includes base=develop and up‑to‑date (explicit size/scope guard requested in review)
  - PR #34 approved; auto‑merge queued
- Architect Prompt:
  - `.codex/context/architect.md` added (process, DoD, outputs, scripts)
  - PR #36 opened
- Coordination + Validation (Opus Auditor recommendations):
  - `collaboration/coordination/agent-locks.yml`: coarse resource locks (backend_core, frontend_components, ci_workflows, docs_guidance)
  - `.github/workflows/agent-validation.yml`: blocks out‑of‑scope PR changes using `.cursor/rules/tasks/<ID>.mdc`; forbids edits to `collaboration/state/**`
  - `backend/tests/agent_context.py`: deterministic AgentTestContext (seed + mock time)
  - `collaboration/protocols/agent-communication.md`: BLOCKED/READY/CONFLICT messages; locks and idempotency
  - `collaboration/audit/opus_auditor_recommendations.md`: summary of changes
  - PR #35 opened (merge once green)

**3 → 5 Agents (Optional)**
- Rationale: only scale when the user’s cognitive load is high (many concurrent PRs, imminent release, high review/merge volume).
- Seat Map (5 agents):
  - Implementer — Backend; Implementer — Frontend; Implementer — CI/Docs
  - Critic — centralized post‑implementation review
  - Integrator — merges/release tasks (no refactors)
- Safeguards: scope via `.cursor` task rules + agent-validation; coarse locks to prevent CI/docs collisions; Integrator limited to release/changelog/versioning.
- Implemented in:
  - agents.md (“Scaling Modes” section; Architect can propose scaling with justification)
  - `.cursor/rules/presets/integrator.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/presets/watchdog.mdc`
  - `.codex/context/architect.md` and `.cursor/rules/presets/planner.mdc` updated to allow proposing scale‑up with user APPROVE

**PRs Touched**
- Merged/already merged: #27 (collab guard), #28 (ruff/Prettier step), #29 (FE Prettier), #30 (poetry `--no-root`), #31 (staging gate), #33 (FE T‑503), #32 (BE T‑502), #34 (Docs T‑504, auto‑merge), backend config default JWT fix (direct on develop via rebase)
- Open: #35 (Agent coordination/validation/protocol; merge when green), #36 (Architect Prompt)

**Open Items**
- Ensure `.github/pull_request_template.md` explicitly includes size/scope guard lines (under 1000 LOC; ≤3 modules). If missing, add in a small docs PR.
- Confirm agent-validation.yml runs as part of required checks; consider adding to branch protection once it stabilizes.
- Monitor develop CI post‑JWT default fix; isolate any remaining test assertions and address surgically.
- Merge PR #35 (agents ops) once green.
- Merge PR #36 (Architect Prompt) once green.
- Release PR #18 (develop→main): re-run checks; merge when all required checks pass; verify deployment.

**Files To Know**
- Plan: `collaboration/plans/inbox/planspec.yml` (T‑501…T‑505; task_dependencies)
- Tasks: `collaboration/tasks/T-50x/**`, `.cursor/rules/tasks/*.mdc`
- CI: `.github/workflows/test.yml`, `quality-checks.yml`, `staging.yml`, `agent-validation.yml`, `collab-guard.yml`
- Backend: `backend/core/config.py`, `backend/tests/conftest.py`, `backend/tests/agent_context.py`
- Governance: `agents.md`, `collaboration/architecture.md`, `.codex/context/architect.md`, `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- Coordination/Protocol: `collaboration/coordination/agent-locks.yml`, `collaboration/protocols/agent-communication.md`

**Next Architect Checklist**
- Verify PR #35 and #36 merge; add agent-validation to required checks if appropriate.
- Confirm PR template has explicit size/scope guard items; update if needed.
- Scan develop CI; if red, capture the first failing assertion/file and propose minimal, scoped fixes (avoid refactors).
- When develop is green, update/merge release PR #18; confirm deployment finishes cleanly.
- If cognitive load escalates (many concurrent PRs), propose 5‑agent mode with justification and seat map; request user APPROVE before scaling.
