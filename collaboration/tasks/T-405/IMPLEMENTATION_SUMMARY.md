# T-405 Implementation Summary

## Task: Wire CodeRabbit critic gate into quality checks

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Lane:** ci  
**Plan:** 2025-09-04-kyros-ci-hardening  

## Implementation Overview

Successfully implemented a CodeRabbit critic gate that enforces code quality standards by checking for unresolved action-required findings from CodeRabbit feedback.

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. CodeRabbit Critic Gate Workflow
- **File:** `.github/workflows/coderabbit-critic-gate.yml`
- **Features:**
  - Triggers on PR open/sync events
  - Fetches CodeRabbit feedback from reviews, comments, and issue comments
  - Detects "action-required" findings (case-insensitive)
  - Fails CI when unresolved findings exist
  - Provides detailed feedback and bypass instructions

### 2. Branch Protection Integration
- **File:** `branch-protection-with-checks.json`
- **Changes:**
  - Added "CodeRabbit Critic Gate" to required status checks
  - Positioned after "Collab Guard" for logical flow
  - Maintains existing protection rules

### 3. Bypass Mechanism
- **Label:** `critics:ignored`
- **Usage:** Add to PR to bypass the gate
- **Documentation:** Clear guidelines on when to use bypass

### 4. Documentation
- **File:** `docs/CODERABBIT_CRITIC_GATE.md`
- **Content:**
  - Complete usage guide
  - Configuration instructions
  - Troubleshooting section
  - Best practices

### 5. Testing & Validation
- **Files:** 
  - `scripts/test-coderabbit-gate.py` - Full test with GitHub API
  - `scripts/validate-coderabbit-gate.py` - Configuration validation
- **Coverage:** All acceptance criteria validated

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **CodeRabbit feedback imported on PR open/sync**
- Workflow triggers on `pull_request.opened`, `pull_request.synchronize`, `pull_request.reopened`
- Fetches feedback from all CodeRabbit sources (reviews, comments, issue comments)

✅ **CI fails if unresolved 'action-required' findings exist**
- Detects "action-required" and "action required" patterns (case-insensitive)
- Exits with code 1 when findings are found
- Provides detailed error messages with finding URLs

✅ **Gate bypassable with 'critics:ignored' label**
- Checks for `critics:ignored` label before running gate
- Skips execution and shows bypass message when label is present
- Documented usage guidelines

✅ **Gate documented**
- Comprehensive documentation in `docs/CODERABBIT_CRITIC_GATE.md`
- Includes usage, configuration, troubleshooting, and best practices

## Technical Details

### Workflow Architecture
- **Trigger Events:** PR open, sync, reopen
- **Target Branches:** main, develop
- **Draft PRs:** Skipped (only runs on non-draft PRs)
- **API Access:** Uses GITHUB_TOKEN secret

### Feedback Detection Logic
1. Fetches PR reviews from GitHub API
2. Fetches PR review comments
3. Fetches issue comments
4. Filters for `coderabbit[bot]` user
5. Searches for action-required keywords
6. Counts and reports findings

### Error Handling
- Graceful API error handling with timeouts
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- JSON output for programmatic access
- GitHub Actions step failure on findings

### Integration Points
- **Collab Guard:** Runs before CodeRabbit gate
- **Test Workflows:** Runs alongside existing tests
- **Branch Protection:** Required for merge
- **Quality Checks:** Complements security and linting

## Validation Results

All validation tests passed:
- ✅ Workflow file structure and syntax
- ✅ Branch protection configuration
- ✅ Documentation completeness
- ✅ Acceptance criteria coverage

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy:** Merge to develop branch
2. **Test:** Verify with real PR containing CodeRabbit feedback
3. **Monitor:** Check for false positives or missed findings
4. **Optimize:** Adjust detection patterns if needed

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `.github/workflows/coderabbit-critic-gate.yml`
- `docs/CODERABBIT_CRITIC_GATE.md`
- `scripts/test-coderabbit-gate.py`
- `scripts/validate-coderabbit-gate.py`
- `collaboration/tasks/T-405/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

### Modified Files
- `branch-protection-with-checks.json` - Added CodeRabbit Critic Gate to contexts

## Dependencies

- **GitHub Token:** Required for API access
- **CodeRabbit:** Must be configured in repository
- **Branch Protection:** Must be enabled for target branches

## Testing Instructions

```bash
# Validate configuration
python scripts/validate-coderabbit-gate.py

# Test with GitHub API (requires GITHUB_TOKEN)
python scripts/test-coderabbit-gate.py --pr 123 --owner thomas --repo kyros-dashboard
```

## Success Metrics

- Gate runs on all PRs targeting main/develop
- Detects action-required findings from CodeRabbit
- Prevents merging when findings exist
- Allows bypass when appropriate
- Provides clear feedback to developers

**Implementation completed successfully and ready for deployment.**
